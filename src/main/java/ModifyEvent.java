    // HOW WE ARE MODIFYING EVENTS NOW:
    // 0) temporary store the old event's info
    // 0.5) if user is trying to change commute time, do the * part first
    // 1) delete the old event (access the week of this event, call delete event)
    // 2) update the temporal variable depending on what info the user wants to change
    // 3) recreate the event with those variables
    // 4) add it to the calendar (access the week of this event, call add event)

    // * HOW WE CHECK THE CONFLICT (FOR COMMUTE TIME)
    // 0) since commute time is an event as well, it has a startTime and endTime attribute
    // 1) for events on that date (call it otherEvent for now):
    //      2) if (newCommute.startTime < otherEvent.startTime || newCommute.startTime < otherEvent.endTime):
    //              3) don't allow to change commute Time (return something)
    // 4) if the loop doesn't return anything, go back to "HOW WE ARE MODIFYING EVENTS NOW" step
    // note: to do the for loop, this class needs access to all the events stored in that date (probably as a list)
